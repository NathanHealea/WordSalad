# WordSalad
WordSalad is a text analysis service designed to analyze the authenticity of private writing samples. WordSalad verifies that a writing sample was written by a student rather then fabricated using other means such as text to speech or random key strokes.

- Paths in the `ResourceModel.php` will be to be changed to match paths in the bower_components directory.
